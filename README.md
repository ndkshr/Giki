### What is Giki?
- Giki is a lightweight dictionary
- Giki is powered by Google and Bing.

### How Giki does what it does?
- Giki is very minimal and dumb, all it does is appends a keyword "define" to the word you are seeking a definition for.
- It then shows you the best and most relevant results in a Web View - Basically a search result page from Google or Bing.

### Why make this app?
- I was learning words, their definitions, and their etymologies for my GRE test. I really needed an app that could help me easily look for the words without me going to google and procratinating forever. So I made one myself.

### Found an issue?
- Reach out to me through the github page for giki or raise an issue.
